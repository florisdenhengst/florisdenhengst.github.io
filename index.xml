      <description>For the past couple of years, I have always loved working with Msc. and Bsc. students. Usually, I have been involved in the role supervisor for the thesis. In doing so, I have learned a great deal about what makes a good AI research project and what I can do to make these projects better.
Below is a distillation of some of that knowledge. Some of it applies only to theses, but most of it applies more broadly.</description>

      <description>Last week I attended the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) in Vienna. Being `co-hosted&amp;rsquo; with the European Conference on AI, the official name of this years&amp;rsquo; edition was IJCAI-ECAI 2022. It was a great week with too many impressions and learnings to list. Here are some personal highlights:
presented our paper on Option Machines as a long talk in the `Deep Reinforcement Learning&amp;rsquo; session presented our paper on Safe &amp;amp; Efficient RL with Planning for Potential at the Safe RL workshop met many great people with great humor, ideas and experience attended keynotes by two Giants in AI: Stuart Russel and Judea Pearl had a nice visit of the Vienna.</description>

      <description>Past week, I attended and assisted at the Reinforcement Learning Summer School organized by Vincent François-Lavet. We had some great lectures on a wide variety of topics, including pure exploration in bandits, the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in RL, MCTS, symmetries and state similarities, world models and hierarchical and distributational RL.
The summer school was hosted at one the theatre halls of our university&amp;rsquo;s new building, which serves as a movie theatre at night: great seats and air quality do help with focusing for 8+ hours!</description>

      <description>Gaussian Processes are a fascinating tool for usage in RL due to modelling uncertainty and data efficiency I briefly introduced GP&amp;rsquo;s and shown how/why they are used in RL Gaussian processes (GPs) are a fascinating tool in the machine learning toolbelt. They stand out for a couple of reasons: some people will like them for their data efficiency, others love them for their ability to incorporate domain knowledge and yet others will love them for their visual or mathematical beauty.</description>

      <guid>https://florisdenhengst.github.io/posts/rl-for-swp-lod/</guid>
      <description>A paper on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for strategic workforce planning co-authored with Yannick Smit, Sandjai Bhulai and Ehsan Mehdad is accepted as a long paper at the LOD conference.
In this paper, we model strategic workforce planning as a stochastic nonlinear optimization problem, learn a generative model from data and use it as a simulator in a simulation-optimization approach.
We show that the DRL approach enables optimizing an organizations&amp;rsquo; strategic workforce goals directly.</description>

      <description>Reinforcement Learning has proven to be capable of outperforming humans on various tasks by interacting with and experimenting some environment. This makes it one of the most interesting and promising AI solutions to problems that require complex behaviors which we are unable to fully define upfront but can assign an objective score to.
In many settings of interest such as in healthcare and finance, we&amp;rsquo;ll want to enforce safety constraints on any system of interest.</description>

      <description>Upcoming weekend will be a virtual conference on reinforcement learning (RL) in real-life.
It is of great interest to me primarily due to its program but also due to its organisation.
The virtual conference consists of two panel sessions and a virtual `poster&amp;rsquo; session with pre-recorded videos. There is a slack workspace for discussion, and questions to the panelists can be submitted up-front. Poster presenters are to host their own video channel.</description>

      <description>Update 2020-06-27: this paper was presented as a `poster&amp;rsquo;(video) at the RL for Real Life virtual Conference. Read more here.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is becoming an increasingly popular tool to tackle hairy problems using data. A nice example of such a hairy problem is personalization. Personalization refers to a task central to many applications of data science and machine learning: to change a system so that its personal relevance to an individual or category of individuals is increased.</description>

      <title>Collecting User Satisfaction Ratings for Dialogue Systems</title>
      <link>https://florisdenhengst.github.io/posts/high-quality-ratings/</link>

      <description>Mickey, a master student I was co-supervising, recently published a paper based on his thesis work in ACM&amp;rsquo;s Conference for Human Information Interaction and Retrieval. His work focused on interfaces for collecting high-quality user satisfaction ratings for dialogue systems.
User satisfaction is an important indicator in the design, evaluation and adaptation of dialogue systems. Establishing user satisfaction ratings for conversation-based systems, however, remains challenging. User questionnaires may yield biased results and typically have low response rates (~1%).</description>

      <description>In a previous post I explained how reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to make chatbots better from its experience with users. RL allows chatbots to learn what to say by interacting with users. This allows for chatbots to tailor their behavior to preferences of groups of individuals, e.g. to personalize the interaction. I recently presented our paper on this topic, specifically on personalized dialog management at the Web Intelligence conference in Thessaloniki.</description>

      <title>How to Create a Music Bingo in Minutes</title>

      <description>I was recently asked to help organise a &amp;lsquo;music bingo&amp;rsquo; for students of horseriding association BLOK. To be completely honest with you, I feel that bingo is probably one of the most boring party games out there as the only &amp;lsquo;skills&amp;rsquo; involved are paying attention and bookkeeping.
Music bingo, however, puts a nice twist to the original game that makes it more fun, exciting and skill-based. Music bingo is like regular bingo with some minor differences that make it just so much more fun.</description>

      <description>Just returned from a lovely stay in Chania, Crete for the Advanced Course on Artificial Intelligence, a yearly summer school by EurAI. Besides the beautiful scenery and lovely people, there were lots of interesting talks to enjoy. Most talks stuck to the theme &amp;lsquo;AI for multi-agent worlds&amp;rsquo; quite well.
Although I learned a lot in general, there were some key take-aways for me:
virtually any setting has some multi-agent aspect to it, but it might not be worthwile to actually take it into account when going from a single- to a multi-agent setting, typically requires engineering and analysis of the resulting system from a game-theoretic point of view.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago, RL founding father Rich Sutton posted a blog post. My reading is as follows:
Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law has consistently made general, compute-based methods outperform task-specific, domain knowledge-based methods for tasks in the AI `sphere of interest&#39; This has served as a bitter lesson for many (all?) researchers that have focused on developing such domain-specific methods General methods will always prevail, especially those that scale with compute Although I tend to agree with the overall idea that general methods are the way forward for AI, I feel that some nuance is in order.</description>

      <description>The value offering of most contemporary chatbot platforms consists of packaging state-of-art Automated Speech Recognition (ASR, or &amp;lsquo;speech-to-text&amp;rsquo;), Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Voice Synthesis into a comprehensive API. The API typically also includes some programming model for dialog control such as DialogFlows&amp;rsquo; Contexts and follow-up Intents and Alexa&amp;rsquo;s Dialog model. Implementing the right dialog controller is up to the developer. Figure 1 summarizes this in a diagram, with the handcrafted modules in green and with a keyboard in the top right.</description>

      <description>I completed the SIKS course &amp;lsquo;Research Methods and Methodology in IKS&amp;rsquo;, spanning a wide range of topics such as research methods, Design Research, many issues involved with evaluation in ML and how the field of IR has a strong history of rigourous evaluation (much to learn there for ML/RL researchers!).
To top it all off, the course was held in the lovely location (see picture) and with lots of great minds from all over The Netherlands.</description>

      <description>I just completed the course &amp;lsquo;Writing a Scientific Article&amp;rsquo; at the VU Language Centre. Although I joined the course thinking I knew a fair share of writing in English, I learned a great deal about scientific writing and picked up some neat tricks to improve writing. As a bonus, I got some great feedback on an survey paper on Reinforcement Learning for personalization I&amp;rsquo;m working on with some colleagues in our group</description>

      <description>Today I completed the HPC course at VU University. The course was well organized and had some interesting courses. Some of the courses contained very little new information for me, though. I would recommend researchers/PhD. Students with some knowledge of programming/bash, Linux and clusters but with no experience working with SurfSARAs offerings to follow the following courses:
Intro to distributed systems &amp;amp; BigData: optional refresher Intro to Linux and Clustercomputing: take, become familiar with Lisa Intro to MPI parallel programming concepts: take, get familiar with Cartesius Datamanagement: take to become familiar with various data storage/archiving solutions and make a data management plan for your research HPC Cloud: optional if interested in virtualization GPU Computing: as a refresher, somewhat theoretical Singularity with containerized applications: optional if interested in reproducibility using containers (e.</description>

      <description>Little under three years ago, in March 2016, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm beat Lee Sedol, a pro player in a match of Go. This game had been considered too hard for algorithms due to the astronomical number of board game configurations and the AlphaGo team therefore baffled experts in AI with their accomplishments. Nobody seemed to be aware that techniques were available to make such a win possible at that time and most experts considered computers beating humanity at Go to be a couple of decades away.</description>
