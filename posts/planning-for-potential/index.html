    <p>Reinforcement Learning has proven to be capable of outperforming humans on
various tasks by interacting with and experimenting some environment. This
makes it one of the most interesting and promising AI solutions to problems
that require complex behaviors which we are unable to fully define upfront but
can assign an objective score to.</p>
<p>In many settings of interest such as in healthcare and finance, we&rsquo;ll want to
enforce safety constraints on any system of interest. Arguably, these settings
are <em>the most interesting</em> since, when the stakes are the highest we&rsquo;ll care
most about the potentially adversary outcomes. Although RL has a lot to offer,
it cannot be readily applied in such safety-critical settings due to its lacking
guarantees on safety.</p>
<p>A recent line of work has proposed the application of formal methods to RL.
These methods rely on logic and automated reasoning to <em>prove</em> that certain
scenarios will never play out. They have been battle-tested in automated
theorem proving as well as the verification of both hardware (e.g. chip design)
and software (e.g. protocols and distribued systems).</p>
<p>By combining RL with formal methods, we obtain the best of both worlds: formal
methods bring guarantees on safety under well understood computational
characteristics while RL brings the adaptivity required for
<a href="/posts/rl-for-pers-survey">personalization</a> in e.g. <a href="/posts/rl-for-dialog-management">dialogue
systems</a>.</p>
<p>In a recent paper, we examined how the usage of formal methods impacts the
learners&rsquo; capability. We found:</p>
<ul>
<li>that by applying safety constraints, the learning problem will generally become harder,</li>
<li>that, if the safety constraints prescribe more steps at a particular state, the <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-02-19-rl-overview/#value-function">expected value</a> for that state becomes lower</li>
<li>that we can mitigate this by assigning an additional reward for steps taken to be safe, using a technique known as <em>potential-based reward shaping</em></li>
<li>that our proposed <em>planning for potential</em> (P4P) algorithm performs eliminates negative effects of the safety constraints, while remaining safe</li>
<li>that we can tune its hyperparameter automatically by interacting with the environment</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper detailing these ideas and findings can be found in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-022-06143-6">Springer&rsquo;s Machine Learning</a>.</p>
