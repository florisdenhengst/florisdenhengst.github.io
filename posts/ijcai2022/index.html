    <p>Last week I attended the International Joint Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (IJCAI) in Vienna.  Being `co-hosted&rsquo; with the European Conference
on AI, the official name of this years&rsquo; edition was IJCAI-ECAI 2022.
It was a great week with too many impressions and learnings to list.
Here are some personal highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>presented our paper on Option Machines as a long talk in the `Deep
Reinforcement Learning&rsquo; session</li>
<li>presented our paper on Safe &amp; Efficient RL with Planning for Potential at the
Safe RL workshop</li>
<li>met many great people with great humor, ideas and experience</li>
<li>attended keynotes by two Giants in AI: Stuart Russel and Judea Pearl</li>
<li>had a nice visit of the Vienna. Managed to see some of the sights and experience the city.
Went to see the 1922 movie Nosferatu with live piano music in a 1870s theatre-turned-movie hall.</li>
<li>AI computer chess championship being held during the conference</li>
<li>traveled there by a sleeper coach on the Night Jet, which was a great experience as well</li>
</ul>
<p>The conference had a focus that seems pretty typical of AI research in Europe at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>hybrid knowledge v.s. data-driven approach. Tons of planning + learning combinations in various shapes.
Temporal logic at the high-level and low-level control. Knowledge graphs for improved classification.
Specific neural net architectures leveraging high-level planning results. Neuro-symbolic approaches.
Distillation of neural net models into explainable models. Common-sense knowledge to defend against adversarial attacks.
Reasoning about actions, then doing learning. Learning+causality. Learning (in) a relational domain. And many many more.</li>
<li>Lots of RL (probably more telling of my selection than of the conference
focus)</li>
<li>Using AI to improve society: an AI for good track and a strong computational
social choice presence.</li>
<li>AI in context: robustness, safety, interpretability. Impact on users/people.
Fairness, preferences and goals of agents. Societal impact of AI and ethics.</li>
</ul>
<p>For proof of attendance and awkwardness, see the picture below ;)</p>
