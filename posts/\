Last week I attended the International Joint Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (IJCAI) in Vienna.  Being `co-hosted' with the European Conference
on AI, the official name of this years' edition was IJCAI-ECAI 2022.
It was a great week with too many impressions and learnings to list.
Here are some personal highlights:

* presented our paper on Option Machines as a long talk in the `Deep
  Reinforcement Learning' session
* presented our paper on Safe & Efficient RL with Planning for Potential at the
  Safe RL workshop
* met many great people with great humor, ideas and experience
* attended keynotes by two Giants in AI: Stuart Russel and Judea Pearl
* had a nice visit of the Vienna, mentioned to see the sights for a bit and
  watched the 1922 movie Nosferatu with live piano music
* AI computer chess championship being held during the conference 
* traveled there by a sleeper coach on the Night Jet, which was a great experience as well

The conference had a very European feel with a broad focus on AI in some sort:
* hybrid knowledge v.s. data-driven approach. Tons of planning + learning combinations in various shapes.
  Temporal logic at the high-level and low-level control. Knowledge graphs for improved classification.
  Specific neural net architectures leveraging high-level planning results. Neuro-symbolic approaches.
  Distillation of neural net models into explainable models. Common-sense knowledge to defend against adversarial attacks.
  Reasoning about actions, then doing learning. Learning+causality. Learning (in) a relational domain. And many many more.
* AI in context: robustness, safety, interpretability and societal impact of AI.
* Using AI to improve society: an AI for good track and a strong computational social choice presence.
