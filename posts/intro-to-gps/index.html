<p>Gaussian processes (GPs) are a fascinating tool in the machine learning toolbelt. They stand out
for a couple of reasons: some people will like them for their data efficiency, others love them
for their ability to incorporate domain knowledge and yet others will love them for their visual
or mathematical beauty. I was first introduced with GPs when studying ways to optimize chatbots or
<a href="/posts/rl-for-dialogue-management">dialogue agents</a> using data. In this blog post, I will
introduce some of the concepts of GPs, discuss their strengths and weaknesses and discuss some
applications in Reinforcement Learning (RL).</p>
<!-- TODO: refer to a generic RL blog post-->

<p>Before diving in to the details of the GP model, it&rsquo;s important to understand that GPs are a form
of <a href="http://fastml.com/bayesian-machine-learning/">Bayesian machine learning</a>. This means that they
allow for some sort of upfront knowledge to be encoded into a <em>prior</em>. Another thing to consider
is that GPs are non-parametric: the number of parameters of the model is not
fixed but depends on the size of the training set, similarly to e.g. the k-nearest neighbours and
support vector machine models. A final thing to note about GPs is that they provide a full
probability distribution instead of single predictions such as provide by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation">maximum likelihood
estimation</a> (mle) or its Bayesian
friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation">maximum a posteriori
estimation</a> (map).</p>
<!--Hence, GPs seem to appeal to different groups and it should 
therefore be of no surprise that GPs have been all the craze in fields as various as ...
Instead of estimating a
distribution of points, they estimate a distribution of *functions*. The estimated distribution
can be used to create point estimates with confidence intervals, so they come with a 'built-in'
estimate of uncertainty. This estimate is useful in settings where points can be sampled
interactively, such as in active learning and reinforcement learning (RL). Another strength of GPs
is that we can specify a *prior* over the functions. This generally makes GPs very data efficient,
a property of interest in both kinds of Machine Learning.

Although GPs are a very generic Machine Learning tool, can be used for both regression and
classification and have been around for a long time, I was first introduced to them when studying
. In this post, I hope to
provide you with some understanding of GPs (or at least some pointers!) and explain how they can
be used in RL. If you won't like them for their mathematical properties, I'm sure you'll like the
visualizations and linked videos throughout this blog post. I will start with a brief introduction
of GPs and then move on to applications in RL.-->
<h2 id="the-gaussian-process">The Gaussian Process</h2>
<p>Hoping not to have scared anyone off with all of this jargon, let&rsquo;s retry with some definitions:
&ldquo;A Gaussian Process is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint
Gaussian distribution.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Formally, some function \(f(x)\) over a set \(X\) follows a GP
distribution as defined by some mean \(\mu\) and a covariance function or <em>kernel</em> \(k(x,
x&rsquo;)\):
$$f(x) \sim \mathcal{GP}(\mu(x), k(x, x&rsquo;)), \forall xx&rsquo; \in X \\\
\mu(x) = \mathbb{E}[f(x)]  \\\
k(x, x&rsquo;) = \mathbb{E}[(f(x) - \mu(x))(f(x&rsquo;) - \mu(x&rsquo;))]
$$
A simple example of a GP is visualized in Figure 2. Here, \(X = \mathbb{R}\) and \(f(x) = Y
\).</p>
<figure style="max-width:80%;">

      style="max-width:400px;"/>
 <figcaption>Figure 2. Data sampled from an example GP. Plot taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#/media/File:MultivariateNormal.png" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.

</figure>
This data is distributed according to
a multivariate Gaussian with
	$$\mu = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, K =  \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 / 5 \\\\ 3 / 5 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.$$ This distribution is a GP,
since it consists of two random variables, \(X\) and \(Y\), that are distributed Gaussian
together (joint). The random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) are Gaussian distributed
individually as well, so this example meets the definition. 
<p>Having checked the definition and a simple example of a GP, we now turn to some of the things you
can (mathematically) <em>do</em> with GPs. We focus on the manipulations that are useful when doing
predictions. For starters, we have already seen that we can extract single-variable \(\mu\)s
from the joint distribution. We can do the same for the covariance matrix (kernel) and obtain the
individual distributions:
$$ \mu = \begin{bmatrix} \mu_{X} \\ \mu_{Y} \end{bmatrix},
\Sigma =
\begin{bmatrix}
\Sigma_{XX} &amp; \Sigma_{XY} \\ \Sigma_{YX} &amp; \Sigma_{YY}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Extracting distributions for \(X\) and \(Y\):
$$ X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{X}, \Sigma_{XX}) \\ Y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{Y}, \Sigma_{YY}) $$
This manipulation is commonly known as <em>marginalization</em>.</p>
<p>Another manipulation that is useful for prediction is <em>conditioning</em>. Conditioning boils down to
expressing the distribution of one variable in terms of the distribution of the other. The full
derivation is too much for this blog post<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, but this is the information you&rsquo;ll need in order to do so:
$$ \begin{align}
Y | X \sim \mathcal{N}( &amp; \mu_{Y} + \Sigma_{YX} \Sigma_{XX}^{-1}(X - \mu_X), \\\
&amp; \Sigma_{YY} - \Sigma_{YX} - \Sigma_{YX}\Sigma_{XX}^{-1}\Sigma_{XY})
\end{align}
$$
In supervised prediction settings with target variable \(Y\), \(\Sigma\) and \(\mu_Y\) can
be estimated based on the training set and predictions on input \(X\) can be made.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Note that
\(Y\) is a full distribution rather than a mle or map. So far, we have seen that a GP is a
distribution over functions with mean \(\mu\) and kernel \(k(x, x&rsquo;)\) and can be understood as
a generalization of a multivariate Gaussian distribution. How can we actually fit it to a data set
and use for predictions though?</p>
<h2 id="gp-regression">GP Regression</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider using GPs for regression. The task in regression is to estimate some target
function \(f(X) \to y, y \in \mathbb{R}\) using a set of pairs \(X&rsquo;, y&rsquo;\) (the training set)
and then use the estimated \(\hat{f}\) to predict the values \(y^*\) for a test set
\(X^*\). In most regression tasks, \(y&rsquo;\) is measured using some imprecise sensors and comes
with a measurement error. This error can be expressed using an assumed independent error term
\(\epsilon\) with variance \(\sigma\). The full model then becomes:
$$
\begin{align}
f(x) &amp; \sim \mathcal{GP}(\mu, K), x \in X \\\
\epsilon &amp; \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_n^2I) \text{ indep. of }f(x) \\\
y_i &amp; = f(x_i) + \epsilon_i \\\
\overbrace{x_1, \dots, x_\ell}^{\text{unobserved}: (X,y)^*} &amp; ,  \overbrace{x_{\ell+1}, \dots, x_n}^{\text{observed:}(X,y)&rsquo;} \in S \\\
y_1, \dots, y_\ell ~&amp;,~  y_{\ell+1}, \dots, y_n \in \mathbb{R} \\\
\mu_{x_1}, \dots ~&amp;,~ \dots, \mu_{x_n}
\end{align}
$$</p>
<p>The next step in the regression process consists of applying the marginalization and conditioning
operations in a meaningful way. Marginalization gives:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} y&rsquo; \\ y^* \end{bmatrix}
\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \begin{bmatrix}
K(X&rsquo;,X&rsquo;)+\sigma^2_nI &amp; K(X&rsquo;, X^*) \\
K(X^*, X&rsquo;) &amp; K(X^*, X^*)
\end{bmatrix})
$$
Conditioning on the training set \(X&rsquo;, y&rsquo;\) and the known test points \(X^*\) gives:
\begin{align}
y^*|X&rsquo;, y&rsquo;, X^* \sim &amp;~ \mathcal{N}(\hat{\mu}, K(X^*, X^*) - K(X^*, X&rsquo;)[K(X&rsquo;, X&rsquo;) + \sigma^2_nI]^{-1}K(X&rsquo;,
X^*) \\\
\end{align}
Typically, the input can be transformed so that \(\mu = 0\), in which case
$$
\hat{\mu} = \mathbb{E}[y^*|X&rsquo;, y&rsquo;, X^*] = K(X^*, X&rsquo;)[K(X&rsquo;, X&rsquo;) + \sigma^2_nI]^{-1}y'
$$
Neat, we now have an expression of the <em>full distribution</em> over values to be predicted \(y^*\)!
This is something not many ml models offer out of the box. We can obtain a point-estimates with
confidence intervals by looking at the expecation and standard deviation at a particular
\(y^*_i\).  All we need now is to get our hands on a training set \(X&rsquo;, y&rsquo;\) and some
<em>evaluation</em> set of interest \(X^*\) and make some estimate for the error term \(\sigma^2_n\).
Oh, and we need to define which kernel \(K\) fits our domain well.</p>
<h2 id="domain-knowledge-and-kernels">Domain knowledge and kernels</h2>
<p>I already mentioned that GPs are a Bayesian method and allow for integrating domain knowledge into
the model through a prior. Where can we put upfront knowledge in GPs? We might know something
about the \(\mu\), should we encode something on this into the model? This sounds like a good
idea, but in practice it is much easier to normalize the entire dataset so that each \(\mu =
0\). What about a prior on the kernel? Let&rsquo;s have a look at an example in which we would like to
predict stock prices. Let&rsquo;s think about what we know about stock markets, let&rsquo;s consider what a
stock market stock size could look like in Figure 3.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/imgs/gp-for-rl/NASDAQ-GOOG.png"
       alt="NASDAQ stock price for GOOG shows a 'random walk' pattern"
       style="width:50%;min-width:400px"/>
  <figcaption>Figure 3. Five years of stock price for Alphabet/Google (GOOG) on the NASDAQ exchange.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
Now look at the kernels in Figure 4. We already know that the stock market does not behave like
the samples shown in (a) and \(c) but more like the behavior in (b). It would therefore make more
sense to select the random walk or brownian motion kernel for modelling stock market prices.
<figure style="margin:0px auto 0px;">
 <img src="/imgs/gp-for-rl/prior_rbf.png"
      alt="Stock market example RBF prior"
      style="width:32%; min-width:250px;"/>
 <img src="/imgs/gp-for-rl/prior_brownian.png"
      alt="Stock market example random walk prior"
      style="width:32%; min-width:250px;"/>
 <img src="/imgs/gp-for-rl/prior_periodic.png"
      alt="Stock market example periodic prior"
      style="width:32%; min-width:250px;"/>
 <figcaption>Figure 4. Random samples from GPs with different priors (on the kernel): (a) an rbf
 kernel, (b) a random walk kernel and (c) a periodic kernel. The prior expresses a pattern that
 is expected in the application domain. See the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/cookbook/index.html" target="_blank">kernel cookbook</a> by David Duvenaud for more details on kernels.
 </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is quite clear that the random walk kernel in Figure 4(b). So when doing an estimation of the stock price in the future, or in between sampled times, it would be a great idea to encode domain knowledge using that kernel.</p>
<h2 id="gaussian-processes-and-reinforcement-learning">Gaussian Processes and Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<p>Regression based on Gaussian processes can be used quite effectively within
various Reinforcement Learning approaches. For example, when estimating
transitions in model-based RL[^4].</p>
<p>Gaussian processes can also used to estimate (V) and (Q) functions within
e.g. <a href="/posts/personalized-dm">dialogue management</a> and for <a href="/posts/rl-for-pers-survey/">personalization</a> with RL.</p>

<p>Note that this kind of regression where each random variable denotes a feature of the models is more akin to Bayesian Regression than to GPs. In GPs, random variables denote train and test points of the model.
