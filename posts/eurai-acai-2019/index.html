    <p>Just returned from a lovely stay in Chania, Crete for the <a href="http://acai2019.tuc.gr/">Advanced Course on Artificial
Intelligence</a>, a yearly summer school by <a href="https://www.eurai.org/">EurAI</a>.
Besides the beautiful scenery and lovely people, there were lots of interesting talks to enjoy.
Most talks stuck to the theme &lsquo;AI for multi-agent worlds&rsquo; quite well.</p>
<p>Although I learned a lot in general, there were some key take-aways for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>virtually any setting has some multi-agent aspect to it, but it might not be worthwile to
actually take it into account</li>
<li>when going from a single- to a multi-agent setting, typically requires engineering and analysis
of the resulting system from a game-theoretic point of view. Lots of the presented work had some
deep connection with game theory, which is quite exciting in my point of view.</li>
<li>going from single- to a multi-agent setting &ndash; unfortunately &ndash; typically also results in
problem spaces that are much harder: they are typically intractable, multimodal and sometimes
even unstable. Typical solutions to get out involve leveraging some feature of the problem
domain or resorting to approximation.</li>
<li>evaluation in the multi-agent domain may be quite challenging. Take the adversarial setting of
learning to play a game. Here, a version \(n\) of an agent may beat version \(n-1\) but be
beaten by version \(n-2\).</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the summer school was well organized and was happy to meet many awesome people working on
interesting problems in the AI space.</p>
