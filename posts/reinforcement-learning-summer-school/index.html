    <p>Past week, I attended and assisted at the <a href="https://rlsummerschool.com">Reinforcement Learning Summer
School</a> organized by Vincent François-Lavet. We had
some great lectures on a wide variety of topics, including pure exploration in
bandits, the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in RL, MCTS, symmetries and
state similarities, world models and hierarchical and distributational RL.</p>
<p>The summer school was hosted at one the theatre halls of our university&rsquo;s new
building, which serves as a movie theatre at night: great seats and air quality
<em>do</em> help with focusing for 8+ hours! A fun detail was the dramatic Indiana
Jones score randomly starting at the end of the final talk by Marc G.
Bellemare.</p>
<p>The two-year COVID-induced hiatus for in-person events did not result in less
interaction. On the contrary: participants were eager to respond to questions
from lecturers, pose questions themselves and share research ideas.</p>

<p>Personally, I was involved in assisting for the practical sessions, which
proved to be a great way to get familiar with the technical content, but also
to get to know the participants individually.</p>
<p>Additionally, I was responsible for organising a quiz on the summer school&rsquo;s
content near the end. This made me appreciate the talks a lot more, because I
had to take notes to ensure my questions made sense. Additionally, it made me
appreciate how hard it is to come up with questions that strike the right
balance between clarity, challenge and fun.</p>
<p>The social event was (big surprise!) a boat tour of Amsterdam&rsquo;s canals with
lunch and drinks. We ended the week with a `pizza dinner&rsquo;. These turned out to
be great opportunities to talk about RL-specific topics and other interests
such as music, history and experiences of PhD students in RL.</p>
