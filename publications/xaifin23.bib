abstract = {There is a growing demand for explainable, transparent, and datadriven models within the domain of fraud detection. Decisions made by the fraud detection model need to be explainable in the event of a customer dispute. Additionally, the decision-making process in the model must be transparent to win the trust of regulators, analysts, and business stakeholders. At the same time, fraud detection solutions can benefit from data due to the noisy and dynamic nature of fraud detection and the availability of large historical data sets. Finally, fraud detection is notorious for its class imbalance: there are typically several orders of magnitude more legitimate transactions than fraudulent ones. In this paper, we present Deep Symbolic Classification (DSC), an extension of the Deep Symbolic Regression framework to classification problems. DSC casts classification as a search problem in the space of all analytic functions composed of a vocabulary of variables, constants, and operations and optimizes for an arbitrary evaluation metric directly. The search is guided by a deep neural network trained with reinforcement learning. Because the functions are mathematical expressions that are in closed-form and concise, the model is inherently explainable both at the level of a single classification decision and at the model's decision process level. Furthermore, the class imbalance problem is successfully addressed by optimizing for metrics that are robust to class imbalance such as the F1 score. This eliminates the need for problematic oversampling and undersampling techniques that plague traditional approaches. Finally, the model allows to explicitly balance between the prediction accuracy and the explainability. An evaluation on the PaySim data set demonstrates competitive predictive performance with state-of-the-art models, while surpassing them in terms of explainability. This establishes DSC as a promising model for fraud detection systems.},
