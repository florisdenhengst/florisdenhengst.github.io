      <description>We contributed a tutorial on doing real-world experiments involving humans and sequential decision making agents to a national PhD course on Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Hybrid Intelligence. This two-day course is about making AI agents adapt to humans using reinforcement learning.
We set two goals for our tutorial:
Hands-on experience with hybrid RL example Familiarize participants with SHARPIE and a hybrid RL algorithm SHARPIE SHARPIE is a framework for creating live demo&amp;rsquo;s and conducting real-world experiments involving humans and RL agents.</description>

      <description>Gaussian Processes are a fascinating tool for usage in RL due to modelling uncertainty and data efficiency I briefly introduced GP&amp;rsquo;s and shown how/why they are used in RL Gaussian processes (GPs) are a fascinating tool in the machine learning toolbelt. They stand out for a couple of reasons: some people will like them for their data efficiency, others love them for their ability to incorporate domain knowledge and yet others will love them for their visual or mathematical beauty.</description>

      <title>How to Create a Music Bingo in Minutes</title>

      <description>I was recently asked to help organise a &amp;lsquo;music bingo&amp;rsquo; for students of horseriding association BLOK. To be completely honest with you, I feel that bingo is probably one of the most boring party games out there as the only &amp;lsquo;skills&amp;rsquo; involved are paying attention and bookkeeping.
Music bingo, however, puts a nice twist to the original game that makes it more fun, exciting and skill-based. Music bingo is like regular bingo with some minor differences that make it just so much more fun.</description>

      <title>How Reinforcement Learning is Applied to Dialogue Control</title>

      <description>The value offering of most contemporary chatbot platforms consists of packaging state-of-art Automated Speech Recognition (ASR, or &amp;lsquo;speech-to-text&amp;rsquo;), Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Voice Synthesis into a comprehensive API. The API typically also includes some programming model for dialog control such as DialogFlows&amp;rsquo; Contexts and follow-up Intents and Alexa&amp;rsquo;s Dialog model. Implementing the right dialog controller is up to the developer. Figure 1 summarizes this in a diagram, with the handcrafted modules in green and with a keyboard in the top right.</description>
