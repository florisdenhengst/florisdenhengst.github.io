      <description>I was recently asked to help organise a &amp;lsquo;music bingo&amp;rsquo; for students of horseriding association BLOK. To be completely honest with you, I feel that bingo is probably one of the most boring party games out there as the only &amp;lsquo;skills&amp;rsquo; involved are paying attention and bookkeeping.
Music bingo, however, puts a nice twist to the original game that makes it more fun, exciting and skill-based. Music bingo is like regular bingo with some minor differences that make it just so much more fun.</description>
