      <description>Past week, I attended and assisted at the Reinforcement Learning Summer School organized by Vincent Fran√ßois-Lavet. We had some great lectures on a wide variety of topics, including pure exploration in bandits, the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in RL, MCTS, symmetries and state similarities, world models and hierarchical and distributational RL.
The summer school was hosted at one the theatre halls of our university&amp;rsquo;s new building, which serves as a movie theatre at night: great seats and air quality do help with focusing for 8+ hours!</description>

      <description>Just returned from a lovely stay in Chania, Crete for the Advanced Course on Artificial Intelligence, a yearly summer school by EurAI. Besides the beautiful scenery and lovely people, there were lots of interesting talks to enjoy. Most talks stuck to the theme &amp;lsquo;AI for multi-agent worlds&amp;rsquo; quite well.
Although I learned a lot in general, there were some key take-aways for me:
 virtually any setting has some multi-agent aspect to it, but it might not be worthwile to actually take it into account when going from a single- to a multi-agent setting, typically requires engineering and analysis of the resulting system from a game-theoretic point of view.</description>

      <description>I completed the SIKS course &amp;lsquo;Research Methods and Methodology in IKS&amp;rsquo;, spanning a wide range of topics such as research methods, Design Research, many issues involved with evaluation in ML and how the field of IR has a strong history of rigourous evaluation (much to learn there for ML/RL researchers!).
To top it all off, the course was held in the lovely location (see picture) and with lots of great minds from all over The Netherlands.</description>

      <description>I just completed the course &amp;lsquo;Writing a Scientific Article&amp;rsquo; at the VU Language Centre. Although I joined the course thinking I knew a fair share of writing in English, I learned a great deal about scientific writing and picked up some neat tricks to improve writing. As a bonus, I got some great feedback on an survey paper on Reinforcement Learning for personalization I&amp;rsquo;m working on with some colleagues in our group</description>

      <description>Today I completed the HPC course at VU University. The course was well organized and had some interesting courses. Some of the courses contained very little new information for me, though. I would recommend researchers/PhD. Students with some knowledge of programming/bash, Linux and clusters but with no experience working with SurfSARAs offerings to follow the following courses:
 Intro to distributed systems &amp;amp; BigData: optional refresher Intro to Linux and Clustercomputing: take, become familiar with Lisa Intro to MPI parallel programming concepts: take, get familiar with Cartesius Datamanagement: take to become familiar with various data storage/archiving solutions and make a data management plan for your research HPC Cloud: optional if interested in virtualization GPU Computing: as a refresher, somewhat theoretical Singularity with containerized applications: optional if interested in reproducibility using containers (e.</description>
