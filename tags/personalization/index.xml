Although I joined the course thinking I knew a fair share of writing in English, I learned a great deal about scientific writing and picked up some neat tricks to improve writing. As a bonus, I got some great feedback on an survey paper on Reinforcement Learning for personalization I&amp;rsquo;m working on with some colleagues in our group</description>
